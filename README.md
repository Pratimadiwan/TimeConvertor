# Time Converter

This is a simple web-based time converter project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert time between the 12-hour clock format (with AM/PM) and the 24-hour clock format.

## Features

- Converts time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format.
- Converts time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- Provides immediate feedback with a color-coded result.
- Includes basic error handling for invalid time inputs.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Read More/Less Functionality

## How to Use

1. **Input Time:** Enter the time you want to convert in the input field.
    - For 12-hour format, use the format "HH:MM AM/PM" (e.g., "02:30 PM").
    - For 24-hour format, use the format "HH:MM" (e.g., "14:30").
2. **Convert:** Click the "Convert" button.
3. **View Result:** The converted time will be displayed below the button. 

## Error Handling

- The converter checks for various invalid input formats and displays error messages accordingly:
    - If the input is not in a valid 12-hour or 24-hour format, an "Invalid time format" message is shown.
    - If a 24-hour format time includes AM/PM, an error message indicates this.

## Code Structure

- **`index.html`:** Contains the basic HTML structure, including the input field, button, and result area.
- **`style.css`:** Provides the styling for the page elements, making the converter visually appealing.
- **`script.js`:** Contains the JavaScript code that handles:
    - Time conversion logic (12-hour to 24-hour and vice versa).
    - Error handling for input validation.
    - DOM manipulation to display the converted time and messages.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for converting time zones.
- Implement a more user-friendly interface, potentially with time pickers.
- Expand error handling to cover a wider range of edge cases.
